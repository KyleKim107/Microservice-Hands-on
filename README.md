# Microservice Hands-On
- [Post-server](https://github.com/KyleKim107/post-server)
    - The Post-Server is responsible for managing social media posts in a microservice-based SNS system. It provides a REST API that allows users to create, retrieve, and delete posts.
        - API supports backward compatibility through versioning with an alternative endpoint:
            * `(GET /api/posts/user/{userId})`
        - Returns a list of SocialPostV2 objects.(Updated APIs)
            * `(GET /api/posts/v2/user/{userId})`

- [Image-server](https://github.com/KyleKim107/image-server)
    - The Image-Server is responsible for handling image uploads and retrievals in the SNS system. It provides a REST API for users to upload and view images.
        - Upload an Image
            - POST /api/images/upload
            - Accepts an image file (MultipartFile), stores it, and returns an image ID.
        - Retrieve an Image
            - GET /api/images/view/{imageId}

- [Timeline-server](https://www.google.com)
    The **Timeline-Server** manages user feeds in the SNS system, providing APIs to retrieve posts, manage likes, and generate personalized timelines.
        ### 1. **Retrieve All Feeds**
        - **GET** `/api/timeline`
        - Returns a list of all posts in the system.

    ### 2. **Retrieve a User's Feed**
        - **GET** `/api/timeline/{userId}`
        - Returns posts specific to a user.
- [User-server](https://github.com/KyleKim107/user-server)
- [Middleware](https://github.com/KyleKim107/middleware)
    - Provides a simple setup for middleware infrastructure using Docker. It includes configurations for:

        - MySQL: A relational database with a pre-configured schema (ddl.sql) and root password setup.
Kafka: A message queue system for distributed streaming, running on port 9092.
Redis: An in-memory data store for caching or fast data access, running on port 6379.
- [sns-frontend](https://github.com/KyleKim107/sns-frontend)
    - This repository provides the frontend UI for a microservice-based SNS (Social Networking Service) similar to Instagram or Facebook. Users can log in, upload photos, and view their feed.
        - Features

            - User Authentication: Log in functionality for users.

            - Photo Upload: Users can upload photos to their profile.

            - Feed Display: Users can view all the photos they have posted.




## API Versioning and Backward Compatibility
- An API specification is like an agreement between services, which often leads developers to assume that it will remain consistent when interacting with other services.

- However, API request and response specifications are bound to change over time. Due to the nature of microservices, where services are often split based on the organizationâ€™s structure, it can be difficult to quickly notify all affected services of these changes. This lack of coordination often results in system failures.

- The most common approach to managing changes in API specifications is for all affected services to update at the same time to stay in sync.
